# Matrix Multiplication

## Complexity: Medium  
**Time estimate:** 3 - 4 hrs

## Project Objectives:
- Understanding of programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements.
- Proficiency in creating and manipulating 2D arrays.
- Ability to control user input and cast data between types.
- Understanding of string formatting techniques to display results in a readable and organized format.
- Ability to analyze problem requirements and develop algorithms to solve mathematical problems.

## Description:
This project involves the multiplication of two matrices. Specifically, you will multiply matrix A of dimensions (n, m) with matrix B of dimensions (m, p) to obtain matrix C of dimensions (n, p):

\[ A(n,m) \times B(m,p) = C(n,p) \]

### Matrix Multiplication Process:
Matrix multiplication is performed by multiplying the components of the two matrices row by column. The result of the multiplication will be stored in a third matrix, C.

For example:

Given two matrices A and B:


## Requirements:
- **Programming language:** Java
- You will need to perform basic matrix operations using nested loops to calculate the values of the resulting matrix.
- Ensure that the user can input the matrix dimensions and elements dynamically.

## Implementation Steps:
1. **User Input:** Prompt the user to enter the dimensions of matrix A and B, and then the elements of the matrices.
2. **Matrix Multiplication Logic:** Implement the algorithm for matrix multiplication by iterating over rows of matrix A and columns of matrix B, and computing the dot product of corresponding rows and columns.
3. **Store and Display Result:** Store the results in matrix C, and display it in a readable format.
