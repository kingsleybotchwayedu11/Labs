# Matrix Multiplication Guidelines and Notes

## Guidelines:
- **Matrix Dimensions:** Ensure that the number of columns in matrix A matches the number of rows in matrix B. This is a fundamental requirement for matrix multiplication. If the dimensions are incompatible, multiplication cannot proceed.
  
- **User Input:** Handle user input carefully by prompting the user to input the correct dimensions and elements for both matrices A and B. Make sure to guide them in entering the data in a clear, understandable format.

- **Readable Output:** Once the multiplication is complete, the resulting matrix should be displayed in a readable and organized format. Proper spacing and alignment are essential to make the output clear. Ensure the matrix elements are properly formatted in a grid-like structure.

- **Matrix Formatting:** To display the result, use a format that aligns the numbers neatly in columns for better readability. This is especially important if the numbers have varying digits.

## Notes:
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(n * m * p) time complexity, where `n`, `m`, and `p` are the number of rows of matrix A, the number of columns of matrix A (which is equal to the number of rows of matrix B), and the number of columns of matrix B, respectively. This reflects the nested loops used for matrix multiplication.

- **Edge Case Handling:** Make sure to handle edge cases carefully:
  - **Dimension Mismatch:** If the number of columns in matrix A does not match the number of rows in matrix B, the program should display an appropriate error message and halt the execution.
  - **Empty Matrices:** Handle cases where the user enters an empty matrix or invalid input gracefully (e.g., if the user enters zero rows/columns).
  - **Large Matrices:** Be mindful of performance and ensure the program can handle relatively large matrices, though for very large matrices, you may need to consider optimizing the algorithm further or breaking down the problem into smaller parts.

## Additional Tips:
- Use clear prompts for user input so that the user understands the format of data they need to provide.
- Display the matrices clearly, both as input and output, so the user can verify the data theyâ€™ve entered and see the result in an understandable format.
